# 50BestRestaurantProjet

## It is a project for the HES-SO Valais/Wallis in the Scala classe given by Professor <b>Jean-Paul Calbimonte PÃ©rez<b>.

### Here is the guideline we had in order to implement the project :

This micro project is an exercise to practice functional programming principles using Scala. Each group is expected to:

Take a dataset from the data folder.
Explore an understand the dataset.
Model the main data elements using Scala classes and traits. If you want to include classes that are not in the dataset, you can feel free to add them. Inheritance and the usage of traits are mandatory.
Read the content of the dataset and load them into Scala collections of instances of the classes defined previously.
Provide at least 5 data exploration services over the data loaded (e.g. aggregate information, filter data, summarize information, query, etc.). The implementation must follow a functional style and different operations (e.g. map, reduce, fold, zip, flatMap) and anonymous functions.
Provide at least 5 operations/processing services over the data (i.e. implemented as methods). These must follow the functional paradigm (avoid state, use immutability, composabiltiy). Mandatory use of match case, appropriate exception handling, and high order functions, recursion.
Bonus: 1 service using futures
